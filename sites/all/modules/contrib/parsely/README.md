# A Parse.ly Module for Drupal Sites

Please note, this module is currently undergoing active development and should
be considered beta.

## Requirements

The Parse.ly Drupal module requires Drupal version 7.

## Installation

Use drush to install or download the module files from drupal.org or github (and place into the `sites/all/modules`
directory.) 

Then head to `Configuration > Search and metadata > Parse.ly` to configure the module.

There is no default tagging vocabulary. You will have to enable it from the settings page. You may use the 'Tags' vocubulary, which comes out of the box with Drupal, however you will need to add at least one term to the vocabulary to use it.
